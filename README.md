# Credit-EDA
Loan analysis of the clients


1.	Problem-
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history.
EDA will help us to ensure that the applicants are capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.

2.	Risk associated here is-
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
•	If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
•	If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

3.	Objective:
•	In this case study, you will use EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
 In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan    default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
 
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty paying their installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study
